===================
 Viber Integration
===================

Viber configuration
===================

`Create Viber bot <https://partners.viber.com/account/create-bot-account>`__ and get Token of the bot.

Installation
============

* Install this module in according to `Sync Studio <https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/14.0/sync/>`__ Documentation
* Install python packages::

    python3 -m pip install viberbot

* Due to `Odoo limitations <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/57133>`__, one of the following workarounds should be applied on setting up webhooks:

    * either delete `line <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/db25a9d02c2fd836e05632ef1e27b73cfdd863e3/odoo/http.py#L326>`__ that raise exception in case of type mismatching (search for ``Function declared as capable of handling request of type`` in standard Odoo code). In most cases, this workaround doesn't need to be reverted
    * or open file ``sync/controllers/webhook.py`` and temporarily change ``type="json"`` to ``type="http"``


 Specific installation of queue_job
-----------------------------------

If messages from Odoo to Viber Bot haven't been sent the problem may be in the wrong `queue_job` installation.
You should check how to install this module in its `docs <https://github.com/OCA/queue/tree/14.0/queue_job#installation>`__
In particular, you need to add `queue_job` to `server_wide_modules`.

Configuration
